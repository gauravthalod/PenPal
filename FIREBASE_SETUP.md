### 4. Verify Database Collections

After testing, check your [Firestore Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/campuscrew-65d5d/firestore/data) for:

- **users** collection with user profiles
- Proper data structure:
  ```
  users/
    â””â”€â”€ {userId}/
        â”œâ”€â”€ uid: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ email: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ firstName: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ lastName: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ college: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ year: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ branch: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ rollNumber: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ phone: string
        â”œâ”€â”€ authMethod: 'google' | 'phone'
        â”œâ”€â”€ createdAt: timestamp
        â””â”€â”€ updatedAt: timestamp

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Database is currently in **test mode** (30-day access)
- Before production, you'll need to set up proper security rules
- Test mode allows read/write access for development
- All authentication is handled securely by Firebase

## ðŸ“± Demo Credentials

For testing phone authentication, you can use:
- **Phone**: Any valid phone number (you'll receive real SMS)

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Google Sign In not working**: Check that Google provider is enabled
2. **Phone OTP not received**: Verify phone provider is enabled and number format is correct
3. **Database errors**: Ensure Firestore is in test mode
4. **Environment variables**: Restart dev server after changing `.env.local`

## Next Steps

After authentication is working:
1. Test user registration and login flows
2. Verify user data appears in Firestore
3. Ready to implement gigs, offers, and chat features!
