## Overview
The admin panel now fetches real data from Firebase and supports comprehensive user and gig management with cascading deletes.

## Features Implemented

### üî• Firebase Integration
- **Real Data Fetching**: Admin panel now fetches actual user and gig data from Firebase

## Admin Service Functions

### Core Functions
```typescript
// Get all users with enhanced stats
adminService.getAllUsers()

// Get all gigs
adminService.getAllGigs()

// Delete user and all associated data
adminService.deleteUser(userId)

// Delete gig and all associated data
adminService.deleteGig(gigId)

// Get user statistics
adminService.getUserStats(userId)
```

### Safety Features
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: All delete operations require confirmation
- **Batch Operations**: Uses Firebase batch writes for data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations

## Testing

### Test Admin Functionality
- Click "Test Admin" button in the admin dashboard
- Verifies Firebase connection and data fetching
- Shows counts of users and gigs found

### Manual Testing
1. **Create Test Data**: Post some gigs and create user accounts
2. **View in Admin**: Check that data appears in admin panel
3. **Test Search**: Use search functionality to find specific users/gigs
4. **Test Delete**: Try deleting a user and verify all their gigs are removed
5. **Test Refresh**: Use refresh button to reload data

## Security Notes

### Access Control
- Admin panel requires specific credentials
- Session-based authentication
- Lockout after failed attempts

### Data Safety
- All delete operations are irreversible
- Confirmation required for destructive actions
- Batch operations ensure data consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Data Showing**: Check Firebase connection and permissions
2. **Delete Fails**: Verify user has proper admin permissions
3. **Loading Forever**: Check network connection and Firebase config

### Debug Tools
- Use "Test Admin" button to verify functionality
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify Firebase rules allow admin operations

## Future Enhancements
- User suspension/banning functionality
- Bulk operations (delete multiple users/gigs)
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Export data functionality
- Real reporting system
- Activity logs and audit trails
