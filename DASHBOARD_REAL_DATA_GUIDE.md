# Dashboard Real Data Integration Guide

## Overview
The dashboard has been completely updated to fetch and display real data from Firebase instead of mock data.

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### ðŸ”¥ **Firebase Integration**
- **Real-time data fetching** from Firebase collections
- **User authentication** required to access dashboard
- **Loading states** for better user experience
- **Error handling** with toast notifications

### ðŸ“Š **Updated Statistics**
- **Total Earnings**: Calculated from accepted offers
- **Completed Gigs**: Count of accepted offers made by user
- **Active Offers**: Count of pending offers made by user
- **Posted Gigs**: Count of gigs posted by user

### ðŸ“‹ **Three Main Tabs**

#### 1. **Offers Made** (Default Tab)
- Shows all offers the user has made to other people's gigs
- Displays offer status (Pending, Accepted, Rejected)
- Shows proposed budget and offer message
- Empty state encourages browsing gigs

#### 2. **Gigs Posted**
- Shows all gigs the user has posted
- Displays gig status (Open, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Shows budget, deadline, and location
- Empty state encourages posting gigs

#### 3. **Offers Received**
- Shows all offers received on user's posted gigs
- Displays who made the offer and when
- Shows proposed budget
- Action buttons for Accept/Reject (pending offers)

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### Data Sources
```typescript
// Fetches user's posted gigs
const userGigs = await gigService.getUserGigs(userProfile.uid);

// Fetches offers made by user
const madeOffers = await offerService.getOffersMade(userProfile.uid);

// Fetches offers received by user
const receivedOffers = await offerService.getOffersReceived(userProfile.uid);
```
