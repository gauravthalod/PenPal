## 🎨 **User Interface**

### **Offer Card Layout (Pending Offers):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Gig Title                    [Status]   │
│ Offer message text...                   │
│ Offered: Date                           │
│                              ₹Budget    │
│                              Proposed   │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│ [Edit Button]    [Delete Button]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Offer Card Layout (Accepted/Rejected Offers):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Gig Title                    [Status]   │
│ Offer message text...                   │
│ Offered: Date                           │
│                              ₹Budget    │
│                              Proposed   │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────── │
│ This offer has been accepted and        │
│ cannot be modified                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Button Styling:**
- **Edit Button:** Blue outline with edit icon (pending offers only)
- **Delete Button:** Red outline with trash icon (pending offers only)
- **Status Message:** Gray text for non-pending offers

## 🔒 **Smart Restrictions**

### **Edit/Delete Permissions:**
- ✅ **Pending Offers:** Can be edited and deleted
- ❌ **Accepted Offers:** Cannot be modified (already agreed upon)
- ❌ **Rejected Offers:** Cannot be modified (already decided)

### **Business Logic:**
```typescript
// Only pending offers show edit/delete buttons
{offer.status === 'pending' && (
  <div className="flex gap-2 pt-4 border-t">
    <Button onClick={() => handleEditOffer(offer)}>Edit</Button>
    <Button onClick={() => handleDeleteOffer(offer)}>Delete</Button>
  </div>
)}

// Non-pending offers show status message
{offer.status !== 'pending' && (
  <div className="pt-4 border-t">
    <p>This offer has been {offer.status} and cannot be modified</p>
  </div>
)}
```
